## API Testing using robotframework and docker
Personal Project: API Testing with Robot Framework

During my journey as a software tester, I embarked on a personal project aimed at enhancing my skills in API testing using the Robot Framework. Inspired by the need to deepen my understanding of this critical aspect of software quality assurance, I created a comprehensive test suite targeting the API endpoints of a demo page.

robot -d output -i smoke .\test\question.robot
*the '-d' tag will create a folder for logs and reports of the tagged test case(s)
